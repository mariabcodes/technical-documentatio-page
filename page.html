    <p class="intro">Psychology is the study of mind, how the brain works, how a person can behave and how people behave together in groups. There are many areas of psychology, such as cognitive and psychodynamic, and some can be highly specialised (eg. counselling psychology). These show how complex us humans are as individuals, but even more so, as groups. These specialisations all tie in the core five areas of psychology and these are referenced in the daily work of psychologists, students and related professionals.</p><p>The five core areas are: </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Social_Psychology">
    <header class="social" id="social-header">Social Psychology</header>
    <p class="social">Social Psychology is how people behave around others. The behaviour of a person can be affected depending on how many people there are around them. For example, only one person versus a group of ten. Their behaviour can be further infuenced by their surroundings as well. Being outside in the fresh air with plenty of space with ten people is quite different to ten people in a small room.</p>
    <p class="social">There have been many studies that explore the differences in behaviour from people depending on these couple factors, and many more. The most famous experiment is Migram (1963) who looked at obedience of individuals in at least six different situations. The researcher found that obedience dropped hugely from many situations. One example is where there was one participant with the confederate (someone in on the experiment) right next to them in the room, 65% obeyed up to the full 450 volts. As a stark comparison, when the participant received instructions from the authority figure over the phone, only 21% were obedient to the full voltage.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Cognitive_Psychology">
    <header class="cognitive" id="cognitive-header">Cognitive Psychology</header>
    <p class="cognitive">Cognitive Psychology is area of psychology tasked to study how people think. This can be anything from how emotions work, creation and maintenance of memory; and all the way to human problem solving. It is a large area and it can help psychologists with understanding of some clinical disorders, such as autism and anxiety. These two particular disorders are complex, but cognitive psychology is one of the areas that can help with them.</p>
    <p class="cognitive">Dementia is another area that cognitive psychology studies, seeing how the human brain changes with the condition and what the causal directions are. There are many studies that show the loss of connections between various parts of the brain and their impact on the development of this condition. With the research carried out, researchers are able to help individuals that suffer to improve their quality of life. As well, they are able to educate the public on factors that can increase the risk of developing the condition. One particular example is the link between hearing loss over time and dementia. When an individual develops hearing problems, they tend to shy away from conversations and interactions with other people. This then impacts parts of the brain that deals with the social side of people, while decreasing how often areas of the brain process hearing information.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Humanistic_Psychology">
    <header class="humanistic" id="humanistic-header">Humanistic Psychology</header>
    <p class="humanistic">This area of psychology is just how it sounds - human psychology. It takes each person as someone unique in how they are, taking in information such as their genetic make-up, socio-environmental factors and development. The area of psychology is unique as it puts the brain, the conscious thought as the forefront of the person. Those conscious experiences help to shape the individual. <br><br>The individual has their own free will, so the choices that are made are their own and there are no other factors that cause that choice. Humanistic psychologists focus on each person, emphasizing that each person is different and therefore the studies need to reflect this. The studies that are done by the psychologists are holistic and look at all factors of the individual rather than looking at the averages of people as a group. This all helps for psychologists to research what makes us human, how we find meaning in our lives - is it language? Is it our family? Or are there other things? This is what they are working to answer.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Biological_Psychology">
    <header class="biological" id="biological-header">Biological Psychology</header>
    <p class="biological">Biological Psychology is sometimes seen as the only 'scientific' area of psychology (although psychology as a science is heavily debated area!). This school of thought focuses on quantitative methods, the results that can be factually proved or disproved. Many methods use modern technologies, such as through scanning techniques - <code>MRI</code>, <code>fMRI</code>, <code>PET</code>, <code>EEG</code>, <code>deep brain scanning</code>... Some techniques have variations, such as MRI and fMRI, which differ to having information over time (fMRI) or having it in the split-second (MRI). The techniques that have been developed through technology mean that the information that the researchers are able to find are vast.</p>
    <p class="biological">Through these techniques many biological causes and effects have been found, such as the development of dementia discussed earlier in cogntive psychology. The biological area of psychology guides the physical causes to the behaviours that individuals have. One sub-area within is the impact of stress on an individual and their psychologic state. PET and EEG scans that are carried out help to show the physiological impact on the person due to their environment.

  <section class="main-section" id="Psychodynamic_Psychology">
    <header class="psychodynamic" id="psychodynamic-header">Psychodynamic Psychology</header>
    <p class="psychodynamic">Last, but not least, psychodynamic psychology is the complete opposite to biological psychology just previously discussed. This area was founded by Freud who studied the subconscious mind and the impact previous experiences, early in life for example, impact the day-to-day behaviour of a person. The psychologist developed a theory that there are several stages that each individual should go through before their adult life. Those who are unable to, remain at the stage they are unable to complete until they pass through. Some adults may get through to adulthood but never pass one of the stages, causing their behaviour to be stuck to that age-group developmental stage.</p>
    <p class="psychodynamic">Of course, the stages can be perceived as outdated to the modern world. However, there are comparisons that can be made to the Freudian theory and behaviours of people. The main topic of the theory should be to not take the wording of the theory literally, but as a metaphor. Using this, many psychologists can apply it to help individuals with some clinical disorders. For example, can help to treat trauma-related behaviours by discussing and working through the trauma that has caused the person to be in one stage unable to push through to their adult stage that they should be in.</p>
